This archive is built from the most useful parts of an older "misc"
archive dating from 1996 and "ncu-test" dating from 1997.  Some (such
as newpath) are assumed in my development environment, so this package
is (along with ded and vile) one of the first to be built/installed
when setting up a new machine.
